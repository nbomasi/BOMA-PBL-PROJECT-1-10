# AWS-LAMP-STACK-PROJECT-1
LAMP Stack Implementation Using AWS

This Project introduces us to LAMP STACK:

## WHAT IS LAMP STACK

LAMP stack is a solution stack that employs a specific group of software to host web applications on a server. This term is an acronym which represents the **Linux** operating system with the **Apache** web server. The site data is stored in a **MySQL** database, and dynamic content is processed by **PHP**.
All four of these technologies are open source, which means they are community maintained and freely available for anyone to use. Developers use LAMP stacks to create, host, and maintain web content. It is a popular solution that powers many of the websites you commonly use today.

**To implement this project, we will be utilizing AWS ec2 virtual servers**
