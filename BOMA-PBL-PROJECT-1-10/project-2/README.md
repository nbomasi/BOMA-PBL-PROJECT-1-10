LEMP Stack implementation on AWS

This Project introduces us to LAMP STACK:

## WHAT IS LAMP STACK

The terms MEAN, MERN, LEMP, PERN, etc are often encountered while using the internet. These are web stacks consisting of a bundle of software and frameworks or libraries which are used for building full-stack web apps. A stack usually consists of a database, server-side and client-side technologies, a web server, a particular Operating system. Sometimes back-end technologies are cross-platform hence no particular OS.

LEMP is an open-source web application stack used to develop web applications. The term LEMP is an acronym that represents L for the Linux Operating system, Nginx (pronounced as engine-x, hence the E in the acronym) web server, M for MySQL database, and P for PHP scripting language.

LEMP Stands For:

* L- Linux Operating System
* E- Nginx Server
* M- MySQL Database
* P- PHP

**To implement this project, we will be utilizing AWS ec2 virtual servers**
