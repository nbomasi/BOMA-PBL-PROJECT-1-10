## What is MERN STACK??

**MERN** is one of several variations of the MEAN stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node), where the traditional Angular.js front-end framework is replaced with React.js. Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), and really any front-end JavaScript framework can work.

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

MongoDB — document database
* Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
* React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
* Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server

Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.
